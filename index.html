      <h3>Welcome to Conway 2 Player, a strategic game based off of <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">John Conway's Game of Life</a>.</h3>

      <p>
        The game is played on a rectangular board of arbitrary dimensions. Each square on a board can be one of three
        things: an alive <span style="color: #3266a8">blue</span> cell, an alive <span style="color: #d13e36">red</span>
        cell, or a dead cell. You are playing as <span style="color: #3266a8">Team Blue</span> and your goal is to
        reach
        a state where
        <span style="color: #3266a8">80%</span> of the alive cells are team blue. If <span
          style="color: #d13e36">80%</span> of the alive cells become team red, the game
        is lost.
      </p>
      <details>
        <summary>[Click to see all rules]</summary>
        <p> Each board iteration, you (<span style="color: #3266a8">team blue</span>) get to choose one dead cell (by
          clicking/tapping on it) to become an alive cell on team blue. Afterwards, your opponent (<span
            style="color: #d13e36">team red</span>) will become an alive cell on team red. Then, the next generation
          will
          be computed.
          We use the following rules to determine if each cell lives on or dies in the next generation:
        <ol style="text-align: left; padding-right: 5%;">
          <li>Any alive cell that has 1 or 0 live neighbors will be dead in the next round due to overpopulation</li>
          <li>Any alive cell that has 2 or 3 live neighbors will continue to live into the next round.</li>
          <li>Any dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbors will become alive in the next round. The new alive cell will
            be
            on the same team as the majority of its parents; so if it has 2 or 3 blue parents it will be on <span
              style="color: #3266a8">team blue</span>, and
            if it has 2 or 3 red parents it will be on <span style="color: #d13e36">team red</span>.</li>
        </ol>
        </p>
